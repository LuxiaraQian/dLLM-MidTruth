## üìñ Description

Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon---<b>temporal oscillation</b>---where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps.
To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 
- **Temporal Self-Consistency Voting**, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; 
- **Temporal Consistency Reinforcement**, a post-training method that uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations.
